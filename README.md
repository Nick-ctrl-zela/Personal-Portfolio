# Personal-Portfolio

This is the readme file! 

I used the following resources the most: 
1. https://www.w3schools.com/
2. https://www.google.com/
3. https://www.stackoverflow.com/

I struggled with using github effectively, and I think that had more to do with it being me working alone. The constant switching made the work take longer and I have little time to get the work done. Plus, I started by making a branch for each file and only realized much later how bad that was. 

Basically all styling is done externally and is largely managed using id's.
