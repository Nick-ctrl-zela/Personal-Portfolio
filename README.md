# Personal-Portfolio

This is the readme file! I spent hours on this project trying to get little things right and then managed to do the bulk of the work in just 2 hours after Wednesdays class.

I used the following resources the most: 
1. https://www.w3schools.com/
2. https://www.google.com/
3. https://www.stackoverflow.com/








I also spent a lot of time with the dev tools open on the example given trying to figure out how certain things were done and then trying to replicate them as best I could  without simply copying them exactly. I wanted to try to copy the essence, not ctrl-c, ctrl-v my way th rough this. 

I struggled with using github effectively, and I think that had more to do with it being me working alone. I saw little need for multiple branches because the constant switching made the work take longer and I have little time to get the work done. Plus, I started by making a branch for each file and only realized much later how bad that was. 

This turned in product is not what I consider finished, however I believe it checks all the boxes and I know that we will be working on it more in the near future, so I will be able to iron it out more over the break.
